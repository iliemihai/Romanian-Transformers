### Sentiment analysis

Here you can find a colab example on how to use the transformers for sentiment analysis:
 * [sentiment_analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vKv1Kp9omFr9y4HlFWUGmiYjHgk5XD0m?usp=sharing)

In `data_exploration.ipynb` we can observe that the dataset is imbalanced, so we used a custom sampler to balance the dataset. Also we observe that more
than 75% of dataset has lenght under 124, so we set max_length for sentences to 256.

## Evaluation Results

Evaluation is performed on a Romanian [movies reviews](https://github.com/katakonst/sentiment-analysis-tensorflow/tree/master/datasets/ro) dataset.
